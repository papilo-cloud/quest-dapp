# Quests dApp

- We’ll be building a smart contract that mimics some of StackUp’s functionalities. In particular, this smart contract will contain functionalities such as creating, joining and submitting quests. Then, we’ll see a typical Web3 end-to-end project is created by initialising a React and Hardhat project, followed by using Ethers.js to write functions that allows users to interact with our deployed smart contact.
